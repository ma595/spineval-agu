## Conclusions {.smaller}

### Key Takeaways

::: {.fragment}
1. **Extend evaluation of ocean models**: 
   - Evaluation of AI emulators must go beyond simple RMSE metrics. 
   - Evaluation cannot be done in isolation of the equation resolving techniques.

2. **Software enabled research**: 
   - Research software engineering is a critical component of research 
   - It brings generalisability, extensibility and robustness to software products.
