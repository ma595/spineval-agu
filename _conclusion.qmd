## Conclusions {.smaller}

### Key Takeaways

1. **Extend evaluation of ocean models**: Evaluation of AI emulators must go beyond simple RMSE metrics. 
   - Evaluation cannot be done in isolation of the equation resolving techniques.
2. **Software enabled research**: Research software engineering is a critical component of research that brings generalisability, extensibility and robustness to software products.

### Next Steps

- Extend to other ocean models and AI emulators
- Translation between different ocean checkpoint files
