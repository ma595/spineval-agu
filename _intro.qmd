### Accelerating Spinup 

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
- Ocean spinup is `slow`. Upwards of a 1000 simulation years to achieve equilibrium state!

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
- Many machine learning emulators exist for ocean modelling that are well validated:
  - How do we know if they are correct *physically*? 
  - Errors can easily propagate during rollout.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Our focus is on the physical `evaluation` of ocean models:
  - Including [equation resolving]{style="color: red;"}, pure [AI emulators]{style="color: green"} and [hybrid]{style="color: brown"} approaches.

::: {.fragment}
- Implement sustainable software that is easy to extend, robust and reusable. 
  - Generalised evaluation benchmark for climate.
:::

::: {.notes}
Temperature and salinity in deep ocean is slow to converge. 
Is RMSE sufficient? AI experts tend to use RMSE over some standard fields. Which means that we tend towards an averaged state over long roll out times
I've emphasized hybrid as well here, because it's likely that ML will not be able to get

- not important to go into detail about the DINO test problem. I believe David is here presenting work on this so please do ask him questions on this - not me. 
- It is important to note that although this has been our development
